# Testing-Grounds

Make your way through levels that will test your survival skills, use stealth or kill them all and be the last man standing!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Things you need, to install the software and how to install them

```
Unreal Engine
Visual Studio
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Installing Unreal Engine

```
Go to their website and download the Epic Games Launcher.
From there you'll find the actual engine
There's a link to it below
```

Installing Visual Studio

```
Go to their website and download whatever version you want;
the community version is the only one free.
That'll get you an installer, which you'll have to follow through to get it working.
There's a link to it below
```

At this point, all you have to do is double click on the .uproject file and you're ready to go!
The Editor will open up and you'll be able to customize it as much as you like.

## Deployment

You can build the project for the system you want, directly from the Editor, that'll give you a .exe file that you can run.
This is if you're on Windows, otherwise it'll give you another format for the system you want to build to.
However keep in mind that I thought this project for a Windows machine so you might want to change things if you want, for instance,
a mobile version.

## Built With

* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) - The graphics engine used
* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) - The IDE used
